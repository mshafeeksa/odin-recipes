    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chai is a way of life in India. Almost everywhere you go—in trains, on streets, in sari shops—you will see people gulping down the sweet, spicy, milky beverage. In America, "chai" has become known as a flavor of tea with predominantly cinnamon or cardamom notes. But in India, chai is not a flavor of tea; it is tea—chai literally translates to "tea" in Hindi, so when you are saying "chai tea," you are basically saying, "tea tea." What we think of in America as this highly specialized beverage is, in India, simply the standard way of preparing tea.

    <h3>
        History
    </h3>
    <p>
        Chai culture in India developed out of British colonization. During this time, the British East India Company was thriving, with tea from Assam, India being one of its biggest commodities. Tea consumption in India grew, and eventually, Indians took the British preparation of tea—black with milk and sugar—and put their own spin on it, with the addition of spices such as ginger, cinnamon and cloves.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Tea leaves or bags</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring water, milk and spices to a simmer in a small saucepan on the stove.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat and add in black tea to brew.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wait for tea to steep (don’t boil it at this point or the tea releases too many tannins – those bitter compounds that make your mouth feel dry).
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain the warm spiced mixture into a mug; this will hold back the whole spices and tea leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir sugar into your chai and sweeten to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
